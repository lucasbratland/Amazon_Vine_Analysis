# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
Since your work with Jennifer on the SellBy project was so successful, youâ€™ve been tasked with another, larger project: analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results

- There were a total of 94 paid Vine reviews versus 39,915 unpaid reviews.  

- Of the 94 paid Vine reviews 48 of them were 5 star reviews. Of the 39,915 unpaid reviews there were a total of 15,556 5 star reviews. 

- This means that 51.1% of paid Vine reviews were 5 star. Compare that to the 39.0% of the unpaid reviews that were 5 star. 

## Summary
There is a definite positivity bias of the paid Vine reviews. The paid Vine reviews have 12.1% more 5 star ratings than the average nonpaid review. This is to be expected. As a lot of paid reviewers are chosen because of their positivity with regards to products. The reviewers know that if they get good reviews they are more likely to maintain a relationship with the client and will be able to get early access to their video games in the future. 

One additional analysis that could be done to back this up is to compare the overall star ratings of Vine vs Non-Vine reviews. I did this analysis and it supports my summary. The average paid Vine review was 4.2 whereas the average nonpaind review was pnly 3.4.
